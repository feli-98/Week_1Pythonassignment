# We're going to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers

# Step 1: Ask the user to input the first number
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Step 2: Ask the user to input the second number
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Step 3: Compute the sum, difference, product, and quotient.

# Add the two numbers
sum_result = num1 + num2

# Subtract the second number from the first 
difference_result = num1 - num2

# Multiply the two numbers
product_result = num1 * num2

# Divide the first number by the second
quotient_result = num1 / num2

# Step 4: Perform the operation and print the results
print(f"Results of your two numbers:")
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")
print(f"Difference: {difference_result}")
print(f"Product: {product_result}")
print(f"Quotient: {quotient_result}")
